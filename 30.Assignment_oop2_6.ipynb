    "# Abstraction is the process of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object to the outside world.

    "# Encapsulation is the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (behaviors) that operate on the data into a single unit, called a class. It hides the internal state of an object from the outside world and only exposes the necessary functionalities through well-defined interfaces. Encapsulation helps in data hiding, abstraction, and modularity, enhancing the maintainability and security of the code.\n",
